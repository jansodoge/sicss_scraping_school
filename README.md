Comments: 

* Concerning the nobel price winners, implement versions w/ and w/o missing values in tables. Also, link the winners with their wiki profile. Student's automate going through links to collect personal-level information from wikipedia? Remove links for all winners, add links for economicsts.


* Text with different levels? Stated like this in the Google Doc version, see my google doc comment. 



* 'Several pages' re-create a newspaper where the user clicks through (e.g.  https://www.zeit.de/suche/index?q=nobelpreis) using marathon or TDF data


* 'Selenium-website': user-login, scroll-down to load content, click on buttons


* JSON/XML: let's use one creative commons dataset, convert to both JSON/XML, students scrape them? (https://github.com/ali-ce/datasets/blob/master/Marathon-Majors/Races.csv) or tour de france data? 



* create EMPTY cells in nobel price winners
